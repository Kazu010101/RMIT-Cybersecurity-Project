# RMIT-Cybersecurity-Project

## Objective

In this team project comprised of four members including myself, the primary objective is to design and implement a cybersecurity improvement and management plan for a new imaginary company comprises of 20-40 employees with a basic SOHO network environment. This project focuses on leveraging introductory Red Team and Blue Team methods to establish a secure system resistant to common vulnerabilities.

Over the course of 5 weeks project duration, our team had:
- Collaborated on decision-making to outline an effective cybersecurity strategy.
- Configured and deployed lab environments for simulated attacks and defense.
- Executed tests to identify vulnerabilities and validated the system's security measures.
- Assessed and refined the cybersecurity management plan based on test results.

This project was designed to deliver a robust and actionable cybersecurity framework while fostering team collaboration, effective communication, and applying various foundational offensive and defensive security practices learned throughout the entire semesters.

### Skills Learned

- Testing concepts and procedures for cybersecurity including virtualisation (creating, configuring, and interconnecting virtual images)
- Installing and using software packages including those for testing
- Using procedures and systems to identify data traffic anomalies
- Connecting cyber security equipment and networked devices
- Utilizing basic Linux commands
- Interpreting and writing basic scripts
- Installing and configuring firewalls
- Implementing Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to monitor data traffic and block malicious traffic
- Utilizing cloud computing solutions for remote access and data backup
